Texture
Get the slice of texture:
	Problem: 
		At the moment, even after calculation, offset are way to small. I have to find a way to find the slice size between two ray.
	Possible solution:
		calculating all the ray and put everthing in an array.
		Then drawing each slice.

BUG:
	When I get to close to the wall, it weirdly change.
	Investigate the way I calculate the height size;
