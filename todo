refactoring the image sprite animation system
I have to check if I load images for animation at some point.
I have to finish checking the refactoring of get_sprite and get_animated_sprites.
I have to be sure the rendering will get image or texture correctly.

Texture
Get the slice of texture:
	Problem: 
		At the moment, even after calculation, offset are way to small. I have to find a way to find the slice size between two ray.
	Possible solution:
		calculating all the ray and put everthing in an array.
		Then drawing each slice.

BUG:
	When I get to close to the wall, it weirdly change.
	Investigate the way I calculate the height size;
	The problem is related to the one above. When I get cloer, there is less ray on the wall so the image extend.

NEXT:
	-> sprite
	-> Floor
	-> Ceiling
